# Assets Folder

The assets folder contains necessary files used for the project's representation, including images, styles, and scripts.

## Adding a Profile Image

To add a profile image, follow these steps:
1. Place your image file in this `assets` folder.
2. Ensure the image file is named appropriately (e.g., `profile.jpg`).
3. Update any relevant references in your HTML or CSS files to point to the new image.

Example:
```html
<img src='assets/profile.jpg' alt='Profile Image'>
```
