## Adding Your Profile Image

To add or update your profile image, follow these steps:
1. Place your image file in the `images` folder of the repository.
2. Make sure the image is named `profile.jpg` (or change the name in the HTML/CSS accordingly).
3. Commit your changes with a clear message about the image update.

Happy coding!
